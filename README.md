# Dirichlet process mixture model for Bayesian pattern analysis
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Experiments designed with the aim of identifying bio-markers in a biologicalframework are usually characterized by a high number of measures and low sample size. This usually leads to inference based on separate multiple tests which imply an high risk of first-type errors. We propose a new approach that identifies patterns based on latent clusters among the measures to reduce that risk. This approach is based on a statisticalmodel composed of a parametric part for the known effects (due to the structure of the experiment) and a non-parametric part for the patterns. Non-parametric effects are defined through a Dirichlet process mixture model. 

This repository stores all the experimental results obtained using the new semi-parametric approach in simulation studies.
